 * is safe and complete: it uses realloc to resize the lineptr buffer to
 * ensure there is enough room to store the complete line. It won't trunate
 * the read or access invalid memory. If the buffer length is longer than
 * the input, getline will use the existing buffer space and null terminate
 * the string, leaving the buffer beyond it untouched.

 * Return: an InputBuffer object
